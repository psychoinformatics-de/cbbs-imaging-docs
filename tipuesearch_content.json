{"pages":[{"url":"datamanagement/","text":"The fundamental concept of this platform is that data are first transformed into a standard layout using common file formats, so that all processing pipelines can expect a deterministic, well described data structure. This setup enables the development of data processing components that are agnostic of the peculiarities of individual studies, as long as all relevant aspects of a study are properly described. The necessary data conversion and layout are performed largely automatic. The procedures are tuned for data acquired in Magdeburg, but with minor extra effort data form other sources can be processed too. For each study the following steps will be performed: Initial study setup: create a study raw dataset Import a new acquisition (repeated as necessary): Import a DICOM dataset Import other data modalities Complete study description (if necessary): Identify data that were acquired simultaneously during an acquisition Associate stimulation and behavior logs with (MR) data acquisitions Identify data formats/converters for non-standard acquisitions (e.g. custom hardware) Convert raw data into the common data structure Verify result of automatic conversion (automatic validation tools are available) Apply analysis procedure","tags":"pages","title":"Data Management"},{"url":"datamanagement/study_setup/","text":"A study raw dataset contains all raw data and metadata on a study, across all acquisitions and participants. It is typically created just prior the first (pilot) acquisition. Its purpose is to record all data in their raw, unaltered form, as provided by the respective acquisition machinery. Moreover, it is used to bind data from multiple acquisition sources (e.g. MRI, eye tracker, ECG) together, to create a reliable record of what data were recorded at which point on what hardware. Importantly, this also includes the logs of any stimulation setup, or behavior responses that are typically generated by paradigm implementations provided by individual researchers. The study raw dataset should capture all information required to reproduce any subsequently performed data analyses. Preparation Start off by installing https://github.com/psychoinformatics-de/cbbs-imaging-container-import , which also provides additional tools apart from sheer creation: datalad install -s https://github.com/psychoinformatics-de/cbbs-imaging-container-import [INSTALL-DIR] After successful installation run the following command to retrieve the actual container image: datalad get INSTALL-DIR/cbbs-imaging.simg Dataset creation To create a study dataset you just need to run: singularity run INSTALL-DIR/cbbs-imaging.simg create [TARGET-DIR] . If you don't provide a target dir, the dataset will be created in the current working directory.","tags":"datamanagement","title":"Initial study setup"},{"url":"datamanagement/import_dicoms/","text":"The raw data import container also provides a command to import a DICOM tarball for a session into a study dataset . To import such a tarball just run: singularity run [--bind=/path/to/tarball] INSTALL-DIR/cbbs-imaging.simg import [TARBALL] from within your study dataset. This will result in a subdataset with the DICOMs in it, that provides the DICOM metadata for easy access via datalad . Note, that TARBALL needs to be an absolute path at the moment. Particularly if TARBALL is located outside your HOME directory, you may need to provide its location to the container via the --bind option, in case the tarball is on a different (network) drive. A session name like xx99_0123 will be determined from the DICOM metadata ( PatientID ) and a subdirectory with this name is created. Alternatively, a session name can be provided as a second argument to the import command. The subdirectory contains a studyspec.json file with session-related metadata (info on DICOM series to convert to NIfTI, other simultaneously acquired data modalities), and a subdirectory dicoms/ , with all DICOM data and metadata. DICOM subdatasets can be archived separately to, for example, build raw data archives (for a lab, a scanner, an institution) that can be easily queried for scan with particular properties (see this demo for an example).","tags":"datamanagement","title":"Import DICOMs"},{"url":"datamanagement/conversion/","text":"","tags":"datamanagement","title":"Raw Data Conversion"},{"url":"datamanagement/tools/","text":"DataLad Git","tags":"datamanagement","title":"Tools"},{"url":"datamanagement/demo_scandb/","text":"DICOM datasets that have been imported into a study raw dataset can (additionally) be collected in scanner (or institution or lab) specific superdatasets. This allows for convenient record keeping of all relevant MR data acquisitions ever made in a given context. The example script at the bottom of this page shows how to bootstrap such a database. Such superdatasets are lightweight, as they do not contain actual imaging data, and can be queried using a flexible language. In the DICOM context it is often desired to limit the amount of metadata to whole datasets and their image series. This can be achieved using the following configuration, which only needs to be put into the top-most dataset, not every DICOM dataset: % cat .datalad/config [datalad \"dataset\"] id = 349bb81a-1afe-11e8-959f-a0369f7c647e [datalad \"search\"] index-autofield-documenttype = datasets default-mode = autofield With this setup the DataLad search command will automatically discover metadata for any contained image series, and build a search index that can be queried for values in one or more individual DICOM fields. This allows for a variety of useful queries. Example queries Report scans made on any male patients in a given time span: % datalad search dicom.Series.AcquisitionDate:'[20130410 TO 20140101]' dicom.Series.PatientSex:'M' search(ok): lin/7t/xx99_2022/dicoms (dataset) Report any scans for a particular subject ID: % datalad search 'xx99*' [INFO ] Query completed in 0.019682836998981657 sec.

This allows for sophisticated output formating. Here is an example that reports all studies a particular subject has participated in: % datalad -f '{metadata[dicom][Series][0][StudyDescription]}' search 'xx99*' | uniq [INFO] Query completed in 0.02244874399912078 sec. Reporting up to 20 top matches. Studies&#94;Michael_Hanke transrep2 Transrep2 Demo script to bootstrap a DICOM database from scan tarballs The following script shows how a bunch of DICOM tarballs from two different scanners can be imported into a DataLad superdataset for each scanner. Those two scanner datasets are than assembled into a joint superdataset for acquisition hardware of the institution. Metadata from any acquisition session can then be aggregated into this dataset, to track all acquisitions made on those devices, as well as to be able to query for individual scan sessions, DICOM series, or individual DICOM images (see above for query examples). # get the tools datalad install -s https://github.com/psychoinformatics-de/cbbs-imaging-container-import import datalad get import/cbbs-imaging.simg # create a super dataset that will have all acquisitions the 7T ever made singularity run import/cbbs-imaging.simg create 7t cd 7t # import a bunch of DICOM tarballs (simulates daily routine) singularity run ../import/cbbs-imaging.simg import \\ /home/data/psyinf/forrest_gump/pandora/data/xx99/raw/dicom/xx99_2022.20130410.103515.930000.tar.gz singularity run ../import/cbbs-imaging.simg import \\ /home/data/psyinf/forrest_gump/7T_ad/data/xx99/raw/dicom/xx99_2014.20130408.123933.087500.tar.gz singularity run ../import/cbbs-imaging.simg import \\ /home/data/psyinf/forrest_gump/7T_ad/data/xx99/raw/dicom/xx99_2015.20130408.140515.147500.tar.gz # done for now cd .. # now the same for 3t singularity run import/cbbs-imaging.simg create 3t cd 3t # import a bunch of DICOM tarballs singularity run ../import/cbbs-imaging.simg import \\ /home/data/psyinf/forrest_gump/3T_av_et/mri/xx99_0138.20140425.121603.06.tar.gz singularity run ../import/cbbs-imaging.simg import \\ /home/data/psyinf/forrest_gump/3T_av_et/mri/xx99_0139.20140425.142752.07.tar.gz singularity run ../import/cbbs-imaging.simg import \\ /home/data/psyinf/forrest_gump/3T_visloc/mri/xx99_0140.20140425.155736.23.tar.gz # done cd .. # one dataset for the entire institute's scan (could in turn be part of one that also # includes other modalities/machines) # this first part only needs to be done once datalad create lin cd lin datalad install -d . -s ../7t datalad install -d . -s ../3t # this second part needs to be done everytime the metadata DB shall be updated # get the latest state of the scanner datasets (no heavy stuff is moved around) datalad update --merge -r # aggregate from the aggregated metadata datalad aggregate-metadata -r # ready to search","tags":"datamanagement","title":"Demo: DICOM DB"},{"url":"datamanagement/tools/datalad/","text":"","tags":"tools","title":"Datalad"},{"url":"datamanagement/tools/git/","text":"Git enables you to track the changes made to files over time — specifically: what changed, by whom, when, and why.

GitHub GitHub is an online platform where you can store and share your projects; it is especially well suited for working on a project with several other people. It acts as a central place where everyone can access/contribute to the project and offers several useful tools (issues, wikis, project milestones, user management, etc) that make collaboration simple and easy. To create a profile, go to GitHub , and from there, follow the prompts to create your account. Resources GitHub offers an interactive Git tutorial that is a great starting point for beginners. The free Pro Git Book covers just about everything Git has to offer using clear and easy-to-understand language. It starts with the basics, but builds up to some of Git's more complex features. If you like video tutorials, the Intro to Git and GitHub and The Basics of Git and GitHub videos are worth watching if you're still unsure about the basics of Git and GitHub and want a step-by-step explanation of how to get started.
