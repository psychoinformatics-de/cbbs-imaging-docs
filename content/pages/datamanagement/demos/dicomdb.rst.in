DICOM datasets that have been `imported into a study raw dataset
<{filename}import_dicoms.rst>`_ can (additionally) be collected in scanner (or
institution or lab) specific superdatasets. This allows for convenient record
keeping of all relevant MR data acquisitions ever made in a given context.  The
example script at the bottom of this page shows how to bootstrap such a
database.

Such superdatasets are lightweight, as they do not contain actual imaging data,
and can be queried using a flexible language. In the DICOM context it is often
desired to limit the amount of metadata to whole datasets and their image
series. This can be achieved using the following configuration, which only needs
to be put into the top-most dataset, not every DICOM dataset::

   % cat .datalad/config
   [datalad "dataset"]
           id = 349bb81a-1afe-11e8-959f-a0369f7c647e
   [datalad "search"]
           index-autofield-documenttype = datasets
           default-mode = autofield

With this setup the DataLad `search` command will automatically discover
metadata for any contained image series, and build a search index that can be
queried for values in one or more individual DICOM fields. This allows for a
variety of useful queries.

Example queries
---------------

Report scans made on any male patients in a given time span::

   % datalad search dicom.Series.AcquisitionDate:'[20130410 TO 20140101]' dicom.Series.PatientSex:'M'
   search(ok): lin/7t/xx99_2022/dicoms (dataset)

Report any scans for a particular subject ID::

   % datalad search 'xx99*'
   [INFO   ] Query completed in 0.019682836998981657 sec. Reporting up to 20 top matches. 
   search(ok): lin/7t/xx99_2022/dicoms (dataset)
   search(ok): lin/7t/xx99_2014/dicoms (dataset)
   search(ok): lin/7t/xx99_2015/dicoms (dataset)
   search(ok): lin/3t/xx99_0138/dicoms (dataset)
   search(ok): lin/3t/xx99_0139/dicoms (dataset)
   search(ok): lin/3t/xx99_0140/dicoms (dataset)
   action summary:
     search (ok: 6)

For each search hit ALL available metadata is returned. This allows for sophisticated output formating.
Here is an example that reports all studies a particular subject has participated in::

   % datalad -f '{metadata[dicom][Series][0][StudyDescription]}' search -f 'xx99*' | uniq
   [INFO] Query completed in 0.02244874399912078 sec. Reporting up to 20 top matches.

Demo script to bootstrap a DICOM database from scan tarballs
------------------------------------------------------------

The following script shows how a bunch of DICOM tarballs from two different
scanners can be imported into a DataLad superdataset for each scanner. Those
two scanner datasets are than assembled into a joint superdataset for
acquisition hardware of the institution. Metadata from any acquisition session can then
be aggregated into this dataset, to track all acquisitions made on those
devices, as well as to be able to query for individual scan sessions, DICOM
series, or individual DICOM images (see above for query examples).

.. code-block:: sh

   # create a super dataset that will have all acquisitions the 7T ever made
   datalad rev-create 7t
   cd 7t
   datalad run-procedure setup_hirni_dataset
   # import a bunch of DICOM tarballs (simulates daily routine)
   datalad hirni-import-dcm \

   datalad rev-create lin

   # get the latest state of the scanner datasets (no heavy stuff is moved around)
   datalad update --merge -r
   # aggregate from the aggregated metadata
   datalad aggregate-metadata -r
   # ready to search
