Toolbox Dataset
***************
:order: 494

The Toolbox Dataset for datalad-hirni is available from https://github.com/psychoinformatics-de/hirni-toolbox.
Usually it should automatically be installed when setting up a `study dataset <{filename}../study_setup.rst>`_.
Note, that by default the toolbox is installed from github by ``datalad run-procedure setup_hirni_dataset``.
If you need to install from elsewhere, you can set the `datalad.hirni.toolbox.url` config to point to another URL prior to running ``setup_hirni_dataset``.
